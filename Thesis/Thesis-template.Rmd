# This code achieves five things:

  # 1. Create plots of evoked excitatory currents versus time (P1 vs. Time) for individual cells and whole treatment groups
  # 2. Create a plot of the locations of all cells that you recorded from
  # 3. Run statistical tests
  # 4. Generate a thesis with auto-updating plots and p-values

# If this file is called Thesis.Rmd, you can knit the whole document into a PDF formatted according to MtA's Thesis guidelines.

# If this file is called Scripts-from-Thesis-Rmd.R, it contains only the code chunks within the thesis.
# Don't make any changes to Scripts-from-Thesis-Rmd.R because it will be overwritten when running purl() in Thesis.Rmd.

# In a .Rmd file, the default working directory is the folder that contains the .Rmd file
# However, in an .R file, the default working directory is the parent directory i.e. the project folder R-work/
# Use here() to define relative paths and ensure that everything is relative to the top-level directory
# Otherwise, R will not be able to find files when you are working with both Thesis.Rmd and .R script files
# Use here() anytime you are reading in an external file

# here() also makes it easier to transfer between different computers
# because each person's computer has a different file structure
# For example, instead of C:/Users/cslaureijs/Documents/R-work/Thesis/Thesis.Rmd, which only works on my computer
# You can just type here("Thesis/Thesis.Rmd")

# Introduction

## Inserting Images

Here is an example of an in-text citation: Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels, digestive processes, and body weight [@demeyts2000].

You can plot figures in R.

```{r}
#| fig.cap = "Here is an example of a figure caption",
#| fig.scap = "Sample plot in R",
#| out.width = "100%"


cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Speed", y = "Distance")
```



You can insert images through knitr. fig.cap can be quite long, and you can also add a label in the form of '\\\\label{text}' When you write a reference to Figure '\\\\label{insulin-pathway}', \LaTeX will print out Figure \ref{insulin-pathway}.


```{r insulin-schematic}
#| fig.cap = "When insulin binds to a cell, it activates a series of molecular pathways involved in energy metabolism and gene expression...[if your figure caption is too long, you should define a short figure caption (fig.scap) which will go into the list of figures]...although it looks like there are two distinct pathways, the downstream components of the P13K and MAPK pathways frequently interact with one another (De Meyts, 2000). \\label{insulin-pathway}",
#| fig.scap = "Insulin binding activates a series of molecular pathways.",
#| out.width = "100%",
#| purl = FALSE


# Note chunk options in Thesis.Rmd
# fig.cap = long caption that will print below the figure
# Caption includes \\label{label}, which enables in-text referencing
  # As you can see in Figure \ref{label}...

# fig.scap = short caption that LaTeX will use in the List of Figures
# out.width = 100% of line width
# Excluded from Scripts-from-Thesis-Rmd.R (purl = FALSE) because this is for the thesis only

# Results

The primary goal of this study was to examine the effect of insulin on neuronal excitability and communication in DMH neurons. I used whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to record action potentials and evoked excitatory currents from `r nrow(summary_df_wide_addinsulin)` unique neurons in the DMH. I analyzed recordings taken before, while and after DMH neurons were exposed to 500 nM insulin. By comparing parameters like action potential frequency and evoked current amplitude across conditions, I was able to draw conclusions about the effect of insulin on intrinsic neuronal excitability, excitatory synaptic transmission, and neurotransmitter release onto DMH neurons.


## DMH neurons are less excitable with insulin

A current clamp steps protocol taken before and after insulin exposure showed that insulin decreases action potential frequency (Figure \ref{ap-multiplot-figure}A). The difference in action potential frequency was statistically significant from a current injection of -10 pA (\emph{t}(`r t_test_current_clamp_steps %>%   filter(Current_injection == -10) %>%   pull(df)`) = `r t_test_current_clamp_steps %>%   filter(Current_injection == -10) %>%   pull(statistic)`, \emph{p} = `r t_test_current_clamp_steps %>%   filter(Current_injection == -10) %>%   pull(p_string)`) up to the highest current injection of 40 pA (\emph{t}(`r t_test_current_clamp_steps %>%   filter(Current_injection == 40) %>%   pull(df)`) = `r t_test_current_clamp_steps %>%   filter(Current_injection == 40) %>%   pull(statistic)`, \emph{p} = `r t_test_current_clamp_steps %>%   filter(Current_injection == 40) %>%   pull(p_string)`).

In four recordings, there were no amplitudes after insulin exposure, so additional action potential parameters could not be measured.

## Excitatory synaptic transmission decreases after insulin exposure

To assess the effect of insulin on excitatory synaptic transmission in DMH neurons, I compared eEPSC amplitudes with insulin relative to a baseline period under control conditions. Insulin significantly decreased current amplitude over time in cells with no additional treatments applied (\emph{p} `r tidy_manovar$'p-value'[5]`; Figure \ref{summary-plot-control}). The decrease in evoked current amplitudes was statistically significant within the first five minutes of adding insulin (\emph{t}(`r t_test_eEPSCs %>%   filter(Treatment == "Control" & group2 == "t5to10") %>%   pull(df)`) = `r t_test_eEPSCs %>%   filter(Treatment == "Control" & group2 == "t5to10") %>%   pull(statistic)`, \emph{p} = `r t_test_eEPSCs %>%   filter(Treatment == "Control" & group2 == "t5to10") %>%   pull(p_string)`). This indicates that insulin binding quickly activates intracellular processes that decrease excitatory synaptic transmission in the DMH.

The changes in evoked current amplitudes were not significantly different across sexes (Sex\*Times, \emph{p} = `r tidy_manovar$'p-value'[7]`), suggesting that insulin acts independently of sex in the DMH. I also found no cross-factor interactions between sex and treatment (Treatment\*Sex\*Times, \emph{p} = `r tidy_manovar$'p-value'[8]`).

## Synaptic transmission is likely affected by a postsynaptic mechanism

To further explore the mechanism of insulin signalling at the DMH, I used a paired t-test to quantify changes in the PPR over time (Figure \ref{ppr-comparisons-plot}). I used PPRs that were averaged per cell over two five-minute intervals: the baseline (0 to 5 minutes) and the last interval of the recording (20 to 25 minutes), which corresponded to 20 minutes of continuous insulin exposure. The PPR did not change significantly relative to baseline values in the control group (\emph{t}(`r t_test_PPR %>%   filter(Treatment == "Control") %>%   pull(df)`) = `r t_test_PPR %>%   filter(Treatment == "Control") %>%   pull(statistic)`, \emph{p} = `r t_test_PPR %>%   filter(Treatment == "Control") %>%   pull(p_string)`) or PPP-treated cells (\emph{t}(`r t_test_PPR %>%   filter(Treatment == "PPP") %>%   pull(df)`) = `r t_test_PPR %>%   filter(Treatment == "PPP") %>%   pull(statistic)`, \emph{p} = `r t_test_PPR %>%   filter(Treatment == "PPP") %>%   pull(p_string)`).

## Neurons with similar insulin sensitivity are not clustered

Neurons within the DMH are not identical. Depending on their location, they can express receptors for different neurotransmitters and receive projections from different brain regions [@baileyetal2003; @horst&luiten1986; @thompson&swanson1998]. To see if any sub-populations within the DMH were more sensitive to insulin, I analyzed the spatial distribution of the cells in the study. I plotted the cells on a coordinate system and coloured them according to the percent decrease in evoked current amplitude 20 minutes of insulin exposure (Figure \ref{cell-locations}). Neurons with similar responses to insulin did not cluster together, indicating that there are no regions within the DMH that have a greater specificity to insulin signalling compared to the rest of the DMH.

```{r plot-cell-coordinates}
#| fig.cap = "The neurons that I recorded were located in the DMH, and most neurons experienced a decrease in evoked current amplitudes (eEPSC) relative to baseline amplitudes. Each neuron is coloured according to the relative decrease in eEPSC amplitude after 20 minutes of insulin exposure. Neurons with similar responses to insulin did not cluster together, and there were no regions within the DMH that had a greater proportion of highly responsive neurons. In this figure (magnified 5X), the top of the third ventricle is located at (0,0). \\label{cell-locations}",

<!-- **Hormone**: A molecule that travels through the bloodstream, or within organs, to change the activity of other cells. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas to control blood sugar. -->

<!-- **Neurotransmitter**: A small molecule that interacts with a neuron and changes its activity. Neurons communicate by releasing neurotransmitters onto each other. -->

<!-- **Inhibition**: A change within a neuron that decreases its activity and interactions with other neurons. -->

<!-- **GABA**: Short for gamma-aminobutyric acid, this is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. When GABA binds to a neuron, it decreases the likelihood of the neuron communicating with other neurons. -->

<!-- **Excitation**: The opposite of inhibition. When a neuron is excited (for example, by an excitatory neurotransmitter), its activity increases and it interacts with other neurons. -->

<!-- **Glutamate**: An excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to a neuron and increases its activity. -->

<!-- **Ion channel**: A molecule located within a cell membrane that allows specific ions to enter and/or exit the cell. -->

<!-- **Neuronal communication**: The amount of interaction between two or more neurons. -->

<!-- **Artificial cerebrospinal fluid**: Artificial cerebrospinal fluid is a solution containing ions, sugars, and other molecules to mimic the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. I used fluid that was continuously bubbled with oxygen to maintain healthy, living brain slices for the recordings. -->

<!-- **ANOVA**: An abbreviation for analysis of variance. This is a statistical test that allows us to quantify the differences between multiple groups.
